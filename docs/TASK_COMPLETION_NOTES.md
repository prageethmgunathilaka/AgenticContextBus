## Instructions for Adding Completion Notes

1. **Use the template above** for each completed task
2. **Fill in all sections** - don't skip any
3. **Be specific** - include file paths, function names, and code snippets where relevant
4. **Document test coverage** - include actual coverage percentages and test counts
5. **Explain decisions** - document why certain choices were made
6. **Note limitations** - be honest about what doesn't work or needs improvement
7. **Link dependencies** - reference related tasks and how they connect

## Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: >90% for all Phase 1 tasks
- **Test Types**: Unit tests (mandatory), Integration tests (critical paths), E2E tests (key scenarios)
- **Coverage Reports**: Generate HTML coverage reports and link to them
